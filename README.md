## Step 3: Defined relations among models

## Step 4: Created simple skelton tables for built-in loopback models `access_tokens, acls, roles, role_mappings`

## Step 5: Migrated the built-in models to database 

## Project execution : `npm install && slc run .` 

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
