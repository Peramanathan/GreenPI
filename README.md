### Preparations: Initialize and Populate Postgres Database

### Step 1: Generated the project 
`slc loopback`

### Step 2: Generated node models for the tables in database
`slc loopback:model`

### Step 3: Defined relations among models
`slc loopback:relation`

And defined relations in `server/models/*.JSON`

``` 
hasOne
hasMany
belongsTo
hasManyAndBelongsTo
hasManyThrough
hasOneThrough
etc.,
````

### Step 4: Created simple skelton tables for built-in loopback models 
`access_tokens, acls, roles, role_mappings` (needed for authentication)

### Step 5: Migrated the built-in models to database 
`access_tokens, acls, roles, role_mappings` (now these tables updated in backend database)

### Step 6: Defined inherited authentication models in node project
Hence loopbacks database `db` will not be used but main database server 
For user authentication

### Project execution 
`npm install && slc run .` 

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
